#Kundu and tree
Kundu is true tree lover. Tree is a connected graph having N vertices and N-1 edges. Today when he got a tree, he colored each edge with one of either red(r) or black(b) color. He is interested in knowing how many triplets(a,b,c) of vertices are there , such that, there is atleast one edge having red color on all the three paths i.e. from vertex a to b, vertex b to c and vertex c to a . Note that (a,b,c), (b,a,c) and all such permutations will be considered as the same triplet.

If the answer is greater than 109 + 7, print the answer modulo (%) 109 + 7.
